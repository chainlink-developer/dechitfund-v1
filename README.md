**DeChitFund** is an implementation of Chit Funds in DeFi. [Chit Funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chit_fund) are a type of rotating savings and credit association ([ROSCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_savings_and_credit_association)). A group of members would periodically pool together a fixed installment. On each installment, an open auction is conducted and the one with the lowest unique bid would win from the pool. The remaining funds in that installment would be distributed to the remaining members.
